# PyMDB: A python library for MillenniumDB

**PyMDB** is a library that implements modules and classes for interacting with [MillenniumDB](https://github.com/MillenniumDB/MillenniumDB).

Most of the classes in this library require a `MDBClient` instance, which connects to the `pymdb_server`, found at the `MillenniumDB-Dev/MillenniumAI` branch.

This project is still under development.
