# PyMillDB: A python library for MillenniumDB

**PyMillDB** is a library that implements modules and classes for interacting with [MillenniumDB](https://github.com/MillenniumDB/MillenniumDB). 

Most of the classes in this library require a `MDBClient` instance, which connects to the `pymilldb_server`, found at the `MillenniumDB-Dev/MillenniumAI` branch.

For the `Doxygen` documentation, follow [this link](https://millenniumdb.github.io/PyMillDB/).

For installing the library, just run the `pip install pymdb` command.
